# Visualization-of-Flood-in-Jakarta-with-Tableau
The Flood Intensity Visualization and Priority Identification System for Jakarta provides an interactive platform to analyze flood patterns, severity, and impacted regions in Jakarta from 2013 to 2020. Utilizing data from BNPB and Kaggle, the system visualizes monthly and annual flood trends, highlights heavily affected areas, and identifies regions needing improved water infiltration. Key insights reveal peak flooding in January and February, with North Jakarta as the most impacted, recording 9,760 evacuation sites. Through detailed Tableau visualizations, this tool supports government efforts in flood mitigation and urban resilience planning.
